1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    
    services:
      app:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile.txt
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
        environment:
          - DEBUG=True
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
    ```

    Adjust the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your specific needs. This example assumes you have a `Dockerfile.txt` in the same directory.

2. **Update your Dockerfile:**

    Your `Dockerfile.txt` may need some modifications to work with Docker Compose. Here's an example:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use official Python image for the runtime environment
    FROM python:3.9

    # Create a working environment
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy files into the container
    COPY . /app/

    # Install requirements
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Expose the port (if needed)
    EXPOSE 80

    # Command to run your application
    CMD ["python", "main.py"]
    ```

    Ensure that the Dockerfile paths in the `docker-compose.yml` match your project structure.

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**

    In the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This will build your Docker image and start your services. You can add the `-d` flag to run in detached mode if you don't want to see the logs.

4. **Access your application:**

    If your application exposes a port (e.g., `80` in the example), you can access it through `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

These steps should help you convert your Docker setup to Docker Compose. Adjust the configurations based on your specific requirements.
