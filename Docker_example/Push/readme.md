Once you have built your Docker image and you want to make it available for others or deploy it to a different environment, you can push it to a container registry. A container registry is a centralized repository for storing and distributing Docker images.

Some popular container registries include:

1. **Docker Hub:** The default public registry provided by Docker. You can create a Docker Hub account and push your image there.

2. **GitHub Container Registry:** If your code is hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub Container Registry to store and manage your Docker images.

3. **Google Container Registry (GCR):** Part of the Google Cloud Platform, GCR allows you to store and manage Docker images.

4. **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):** A fully managed container registry provided by AWS.

5. **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** A managed Docker registry service in Azure.

Here are the general steps to push your Docker image to a registry:

### Docker Hub Example:

1. **Login to Docker Hub:**
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2. **Tag your image with your Docker Hub username and repository name:**
    ```bash
    docker tag first_app:2.1 your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:first_app-2.1
    ```

3. **Push the image to Docker Hub:**
    ```bash
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-repo-name:first_app-2.1
    ```

Replace `your-dockerhub-username` and `your-repo-name` with your Docker Hub username and the desired repository name.

Note: Make sure your image is properly tagged before pushing it.

For other registries, the steps are similar, but you'll need to replace the registry-specific commands. For example, with GitHub Container Registry, you would replace `docker login` with `ghcr.io` and adjust the repository path accordingly.

Remember that private registries may require additional authentication steps. Refer to the documentation of the specific registry you are using for more details.
