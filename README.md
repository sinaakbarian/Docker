# Docker

This is repo for docker impletation and understanding
summary of the 3 hours video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE
what is container?  a way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration 
container lives in the container repository and and if you go to docker hub websire you could find official and non official container images
with container we do not need to install packages in the operating system and other team member will just use the docker and they do not need to have different packages
container is stack images on each other what is image here?
base image -> linux
on top we have apllication image

docker Image is artifact in running aroung and docker container is when it is running docker ps showing all the running docker 



docker vs virtual machine? size docker image is smaller since it does not have os kernel so it is faster as well since it only have on top
